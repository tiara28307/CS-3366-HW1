Issues with design - 
This is the control interface for Texas Tech's library elevator. The design is confusing and misleading. Important details are excluded from the design.

Explanation - 
When entering the elevator the control panel to go up and down has no arrows it is based on the assumption that the top button should go up and the bottom goes down. When pressing the outside control panel it is connected to both elevators so either one could open as seen in the gif the elevator I was standing at did not open the one to the left did.

GETTING B:

Common Uses - 
1) Form of transport for people from one floor to the next.
2) Moving heavy objects from one floor to another for example in construction work.
3) Express elevators used to move people from lobby floor to one of the highest floors skipping over other floors.
4) Some parking garages use elevators to get people and cars from one floor to the next.

Rare Uses - 
1) Stage lift elevator to raise and lower sections of a stage.
2) Dummbwaiters are small elevators used to transport small objects or loads like food or books.

Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
Yes because it allows the user to know where they are transporting to.

What is the common sequence of actions?
User presses up or down button. Elevator doors open. User presses another button depending on what floor they want to go to. Elevator rises or lowers. Once floor is reached elevator doors open on new floor. 

How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?
The usage of buttons, numbers, and simple descriptions of what each floor is for.

How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
Color visuals and sound. When a button is pressed it lights up to show that it has been pressed. Sound when elevator doors open and close. 

What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
Outside control panel you can accidently press the wrong button when trying to go up or down.
The buttons are side by side and up and down in the elevator so can be confusing on what direction is which.
Some buttons have numbers while others only have letters for example Ground Floor is represented by a G.

Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.
